## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

  

PyxMap is a project that captures images from a camera, converts them into ASCII art, and stores them in a database. It also includes QR code reading functionality to identify users.

  

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

  

Install all the required packages and launch the Python `main.py` file!

  

## üéà Installation and Usage Protocol <a name="usage"></a>

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install the required packages:

   You can install the necessary packages using the `requirements.txt` file. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:

   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install all the required packages and their versions needed to run the application.

3. Install the Pyzbar library:

   The Pyzbar library installation is different depending on the computer you are using. You can also learn more from [Pyzbar‚Äôs official documentation](https://pypi.org/project/pyzbar/) page.

   - **Mac OS version:**

     ```bash
     brew install zbar
     ```

   - **Windows OS version:**

     ```bash
     python -m pip install pyzbar
     ```

### Usage Protocol

1. Set up your environment variables and API keys (if necessary) for any external services used in the project, such as Google Cloud services.

2. Ensure that the `config.json` file contains the appropriate configuration settings for the application.

3. Run the `main.py` script:

   Open a terminal (Linux) or command prompt (Windows) and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will start the main application loop, which captures QR codes, processes the images, saves the ASCII images, and adds them to the database.

4. To stop the application, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal or command prompt.

Please note that some features, such as text-to-speech, may be available only on specific platforms (e.g., macOS). The application will automatically detect the platform and enable or disable these features accordingly.
